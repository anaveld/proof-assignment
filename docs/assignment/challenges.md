## what to expect

We (both us and you) will probably learn from this little coding exercise:

- researching a good library for your needs
    + or create your code if there is none that fits
- how comfortable you feel with using some kind of "black box" framework
    + learn to balance when to ask and when to dig to understand
    + learn to provide positive feedback to make something improve
- try to be better
    + apply as many best practices (that don't slow you down too much) as you can 
    + don't overthink the issues you find
