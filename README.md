If you want to get a glimpse of how it looks like working at [Proof](https://proofmedia.io/) as a Pythonista developer on Backend APIs, you can try to have fun a few days with this "repo exercise".

If you do want to continue, please:

1. fork this project 
2. work on it
3. present your code to me as a `pull-request` here on GitHub.
